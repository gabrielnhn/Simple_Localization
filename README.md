# Simple_Localization
## 'Mobile Robotics' Assignment #12

Given a map with 5 landmarks, the 'robot' is able to deduce its coordinates given its distance to 3 of these landmarks.

### `map_module.py`
is a messy module to make a new map with random landmarks

### `simulation.py`
is the script used to plot the map, its landmarks, the robot's actual position (the intersection of the lines) and its deduced position (black circle).

### `results/`
is where some resulting png files were stored to give an example of how the script works
